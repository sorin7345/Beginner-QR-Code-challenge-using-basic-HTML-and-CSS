### What I learned

By performing this challange, not only was my first solo coding challange, but also a quite succesful first attempt of some simple coding on my own. I have learned how to keep trying every possible solution that can cross my mind, to not give up whenever hitting a wall and also to better my abilities of writing code on my own and to finding or adapting other similar coding colutions to my own project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img
  src="images/image-qr-code.jpg"
  alt="qr-code-picture"
  height="100"
  weight="150"
  class="qr-code"
/>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-color: #fff;
  height: 515px;
  width: 325px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  margin-left: 500px;
  margin-top: 200px;
  margin-bottom: 200px;
}
```

### Continued development

Regarding my future coding experiences, I will continue focusing on HTML and CSS for now, until I have a better understanding of the two, as I am only beggining my coding journey. After mastering these two, I will most likely focus my attention on JavaScript and further improve my front-end coding skills.

### Useful resources
